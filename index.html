    <p class="alert"><b>ALERT:</b> Pardon our dust! This website going through a major overhaul over the next few weeks! We are going to update the design and functionality of the site to make it more useful and accessible. <a href="mailto:contact@p2phack.club">If something is broken, please tell us!</a></p>
    <h1>Hypixel Game Night</h1>
    <h2>5-6PM+ MST, Every Friday</h2>
    <h4><a href="https://p2phack.club">Hosted by P2P Hack Club</a></h4>
    <h3>
      A <b>weekly game</b> night where students from
      <a href="https://www.peaktopeak.org/">Peak to Peak Charter School</a> can
      hang out and play Minecraft together!
    </h3>
    <p>
      So,
      <a href="https://www.bvsd.org/parents-students/academics/secondary-home-learning"
        >we are going to be home for a while.</a
      >
      Without school, we wanted to create something that would bring us together. That's why we've created Hypixel Game Night. After online school finishes for the week, what better way is there to wind down than playing Minecraft with friends!
    </p>
    <p>
      These calls are low-stress hangouts, where we play whatever we are feeling like.
      <a href="https://hypixel.net/play/"
        >Stuff like BedWars, SkyWars, Murder Mystery, Arcade Games, and more!</a
